Hi there, I am Avanish Sanghvi!ðŸ‘‹   
- A little about me:   </br> I am popularly hailed for my leadership qualities by my mentors and friends alike. My never ending zest for learning is one of the primary reasons why I found attending and participating in debates a stimulating experience which contributed in me becoming one of the most avid debaters, today. Looking to build a career around security sector, I enjoy working in the cyber security sector and participating in various hackathons. Cyber and network security is something where I find solace. Alongside my keen interest in the security domain, with Python as my preferred coding language, I am also getting acquainted with concepts of Machine Learning and algorithms. World politics is one of my pet topics amongst other topical socio-economic subjects. A true Cancerian, I am an out and out people person. I like to keep people around me in good spirits, making me an upbeat friend to hang out with. An ardent reader and self-admittedly, a football fanatic, I also find solace in music. I am also a firm believer in gender equality and my support for the #HeForShe campaign represents the strong advocacy for the cause.   
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project (interning) with the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO), India.   
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an active role in the Security domain. Cyber, Network & Information Security; interest me!
